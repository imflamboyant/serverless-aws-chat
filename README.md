# Serverless AWS Chat

This repository contains examples for creating a serverless infrastructure for supporting a real-time chat application
using two different approaches - IoT Core and AppSync Events. Both projects are serverless, cheap to run and explore a 
plethora of AWS services to achieve the real-time communication between connected clients. Besides the two backend projects,
there is a small HTML & JS client which can be used to easily test both solutions. Each project contains instructions on
how to deploy and run this on your own AWS account.

Enjoy!
